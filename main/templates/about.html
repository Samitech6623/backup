    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
        EdenField Kindergarten is a nurturing early learning center located in Muchatha, Kiambu County — between Ruaka and Banana.<br>
        We are dedicated to helping children grow through love, play, and structured learning.<br>
        We believe that the foundation of a happy, successful life begins in the early years — and we're here to make every moment count.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our experienced and compassionate teachers are the heart of our learning community.<br>
        Each educator is carefully selected not only for their qualifications but also for their passion for early childhood development.<br>
        Our classrooms are safe, vibrant, and thoughtfully designed to inspire curiosity and creativity.<br>
        With small class sizes, personalized attention, and a warm, welcoming atmosphere, we ensure every child feels seen, supported, and empowered to learn at their own pace.<br>
        The combination of nurturing staff and a stimulating environment makes EdenField the perfect place for young minds to grow and thrive.
